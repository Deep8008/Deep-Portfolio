# Library System (Python Exercise)

**Date:** 2025/05/08
**Level:** Beginner / OOP Practice  

## Project Description
This is a simple **command-line Library Management System** written in Python.  
You can:
- **Add** a new book (title & author)  
- **Remove** a book by title  
- **Search** for a book by title  
- **Show** all books currently in the library  

The project is structured into modules:  
- `mylibrary/library.py` → contains the `Library` class and its methods  
- `main.py` → provides a menu-based CLI for interacting with the library  

## Skills & Concepts Used
- Python basics  
- Object-Oriented Programming (**classes & methods**)  
- Lists and dictionaries  
- Loops (`while`)  
- Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`)  
- Modularization (splitting code into multiple files)  

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Make sure you have Python installed  
3. Run the main file:
```bash
python main.py
