## Project Description
This is a simple **command-line ToDoList application** written in Python.  

Features:  
- Add tasks with **job name, description, and priority**  
- Remove tasks by job name  
- Show all tasks sorted by priority (Very High â†’ Low)  
- Tasks are stored in a CSV file that persists between sessions  

The first time you run the program, you will be asked to provide a path for the CSV file.  
All future runs will automatically read/write from that path.

- Classes and objects  
- Lists and sorting (`__lt__`)  
- File handling (CSV)  
- Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`)  
- User input (`input()`)
