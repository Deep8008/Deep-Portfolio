# Guess My Number (Python Exercise)

**Date:** 2025/26/07
**Level:** Beginner / Practice  

## Project Description
This is a simple command-line game where the computer randomly chooses a number between **1 and 20**, and you have to guess it.  
The game gives you hints until you find the correct number:
- If your guess is **too high**, it says: *"My number is smaller than yours<"*  
- If your guess is **too low**, it says: *"My number is bigger than yours>"*  
- If your guess is correct, it says: *"You guessed the Right number!"*  

At the end, the program tells you how many attempts it took and asks if you want to play again.  

## Skills & Concepts Used
- Python basics  
- Functions (`def`)  
- Loops (`while`)  
- Conditional statements (`if-elif-else`)  
- Random number generation (`random.randint`)  
- User input (`input()`)  

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Make sure you have Python installed  
3. Run the program in terminal:
```bash
python "Guess_My_Number.py"
